EVMBitcoinToken (eBTC) on PulseChain: A Comprehensive White Paper


Abstract

This white paper presents an in-depth exploration of EVMBitcoinToken (eBTC), a novel digital meme token operating on the PulseChain network. eBTC embodies the game theory principles of Bitcoin and leverages the most advanced blockchain technology, PulseChain, making it a unique and promising player in the cryptocurrency market.


Introduction

EVMBitcoinToken, colloquially known as eBTC, is a digital token that operates on the PulseChain network. This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of eBTC, its features, and its role within the PulseChain ecosystem.


Tokenomics

The tokenomics of eBTC draw inspiration from Bitcoin, with a unique twist. Instead of the traditional mining process, eBTC is minted. This minting process involves paying a gas fee, which in turn creates eBTC. At its inception, eBTC starts with a supply of zero, ensuring a fair and equitable start for all participants. There is no premine or founder allocation, reinforcing the commitment to equitable distribution. The amount of eBTC a user can mint is determined by the equation: Time + Gas = percentage of supply. This innovative approach to tokenomics ensures a fair and decentralized distribution of eBTC, aligning with the ethos of the blockchain and cryptocurrency community.


Game Theory and Blockchain Technology

eBTC applies the game theory principles of Bitcoin to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This unique application positions eBTC as a perfect meme in the crypto space. eBTC operates on PulseChain, one of the most modern and efficient blockchain technologies available today. PulseChain’s affordability makes participation in eBTC accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial status. This combination of proven game theory and cutting-edge blockchain technology positions eBTC as a unique and promising player in the cryptocurrency market.


Rate of Distribution

The distribution of eBTC is designed to be both fair and sustainable. The minting rate starts at 50 eBTC per mint, with a limit of 25 mints per wallet. However, users are free to create as many wallets as they wish.
The minting rate is halved every 210,000 transactions. This halving mechanism, similar to Bitcoin’s, ensures a steady and predictable supply of eBTC. The minting will continue until all 21 million eBTC are minted out.
The mathematical formula for the minting rate is as follows:


MR = \frac{50}{2^{n}}

where MR is the minting rate and n is the number of times 210,000 transactions have occurred.
The total supply of eBTC (TS) after n halvings can be calculated as follows:
TS = \sum_{i=0}^{n} 210000 \times \frac{50}{2^{i}}
This distribution model ensures a fair allocation of eBTC, allowing as many participants as possible to get involved in the eBTC ecosystem.


The Power of Memes and eBTC’s Aspiration

Memes are powerful tools for communication in the digital age. They are simple, relatable, and can quickly go viral, spreading ideas across the globe in an instant. This power lies in their ability to encapsulate complex ideas in a simple and engaging format.
Blockchains, like memes, are a form of free speech. They allow for the decentralized and uncensored exchange of ideas and value. When a good idea is presented as a meme on a blockchain, it has the potential to spread rapidly and influence a large audience.
Good ideas have a way of expressing themselves simply, and memes are a testament to this.
eBTC strives to embody the perfect meme. It leverages the power of memes and the freedom of blockchains to spread its vision and value proposition. eBTC is more than just a token; it’s an idea, a meme that represents the fusion of proven game theory and cutting-edge blockchain technology. By striving to be the perfect meme, eBTC aims to go viral, spreading its value and vision to people around the world.


Community Foundation and Participation

eBTC is a unique project in the sense that it was founded by the community, for the community. Unlike many other projects, eBTC does not have a central leadership or team. Instead, it operates entirely based on community participation. This means that every aspect of eBTC, from its inception to its ongoing development and maintenance, is handled by community members.
Community members have made significant contributions to the project, including building front ends to mint eBTC. One such example is the community-developed website, notyourmomsbitcoin.com. These contributions are a testament to the collaborative spirit and dedication of the eBTC community.


No Expectation of Profit

It’s important to note that eBTC is not a profit-driven project. The goal of eBTC is not to generate profit from the work of others, but rather to create a community-driven token that embodies the principles of game theory and leverages advanced blockchain technology. As such, participation in the eBTC project is driven by a shared interest in the technology and the desire to contribute to the community, rather than the expectation of profit.
In conclusion, eBTC is a testament to the power of community collaboration and the potential of blockchain technology. It represents a new kind of project in the crypto space - one that is truly decentralized, community-driven, and free from the expectation of profit.

Conclusion
EVMBitcoinToken (eBTC) represents a unique fusion of Bitcoin’s game theory and the advanced technology of PulseChain. With its innovative tokenomics and distribution model, eBTC stands as a promising and accessible digital token in the cryptocurrency market.
